Construct Plugin SDK
====================

The SDK folder should be in the same directory as your IDE folder, eg:

Construct\IDE
Construct\SDK

This way the SDK builds directly in to the IDE's Plugins directory.

The 'MFC VC6-8 Static' folder contains the SDK configured for Visual C++ 6.0 (.dsw) and Visual Studio 2005 (.sln), with MFC.  The 'Win32 VC8-9 Static' folder contains the SDK configured to not use MFC, which produces a smaller file size.  The SDK ports to and compiles under Visual Studio 2008 (version 9) as well.  The projects/solutions with _vc9 after them are for VS 2008.

The SDK no longer supports dynamic linkage to the MFC or CRT DLLs, because this causes compatibility and distribution problems.

Here is an overview of the template filesizes produced by each of the SDKs.

		   | Support MFC	| Release filesize	| Runtime filesize
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MFC VC6 Static	     Yes		  124kb			  124kb
MFC VC8 Static	     Yes		  197kb			  195kb
Win32 VC8-9 Static   No			  89kb			  89kb
